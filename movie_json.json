Wiktor's attention is immediately captured by Zula (Joanna Kulig), an ambitious and captivating young woman who is faking a peasant identity and is on probation after attacking her abusive father. Wiktor and Zula quickly fall into a deep and obsessive attraction with each other and have sex after a performance. Later, Wiktor and Irena are pressured by bureaucrats to include pro-Communist and pro-Stalinist propaganda in their performances, a decision which would allow the troupe to tour the eastern bloc. Both Wiktor and Irena are opposed to the changes, but the career-driven, opportunistic Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc) agrees to the additions, and a resentful Irena quits. Kaczmarek is also interested in Zula and pressures her into spying on Wiktor for him, but Zula refuses to tell him any incriminating information. When the ensemble visits East Berlin, Wiktor plans to flee to the west with Zula, and the two affirm their love and passion. However, Zula fails to show up at a rendezvous with Wiktor, so he crosses the border alone. \n\nYears later, Zula meets Wiktor in Paris, where he is working at a jazz club. Though they both have other partners, their continued mutual attraction is clear. When Wiktor asks Zula why she failed to appear with him to cross the border, she says she lacked confidence in herself. A year later, Wiktor attends one of the troupe's performances in Yugoslavia, where Zula spots him in the audience and becomes visibly shaken. Two years later, Wiktor is working in Paris as a film score composer, where Zula reunites with him; she has married another man to obtain a visa and be with Wiktor. Wiktor attempts to build a solo career for Zula, including inflating her backstory to appear more interesting to his friend, film producer Michel, at a party, which annoys her. Meanwhile, Zula becomes jealous of Wiktor's past lovers, and as work on her record strains their relationship, she begins to drink heavily and act out in public. Wiktor and Zula finish Zula's record, but a disappointed Zula remains frustrated and unhappy. She reveals that she had an affair with Michel and insults Wiktor, causing him to strike her. She later disappears, and when Wiktor confronts Michel, he reveals she has returned to Poland.\n\n"

Emad is also a popular instructor at a local school, where the youth joke about him being a \"salesman.\" One night, their apartment begins to collapse and they flee the building with the other residents. Desperate to find a place to live, their fellow actor Babak secures another apartment for them, where a woman has recently moved out, although she left in a hurry abandoning numerous belongings. One night, Rana is home alone and begins bathing. When Emad returns, he finds she is missing and the bathroom is covered with blood. He rushes to the hospital, where he is informed by his neighbours about his wife's condition and is told to change the apartment's locks. It becomes apparent that Rana has not had an accident, but has been assaulted by an intruder. Emad also learns from neighbours that the previous tenant was a prostitute, who had conflicts with her clients.\n\nRana returns home, but suffers from trauma and is reluctant to go to the police. She does not bathe, fearing to go into the bathroom again, and in the middle of a performance, breaks down in tears and leaves the stage. Although she does not remember the face of her attacker, Emad finds the culprit left his car keys, which he matches to a pick-up parked outside. The attacker also left behind  a mobile phone and money which Rana purchased groceries with, thinking Emad had left it for her. Emad increasingly blames Babak for hiding the truth about the former tenant. After he hears a loving message from Babak on the previous tenant's answering machine, he calls Babak's character Charley a degenerate in the midst of a performance, although this is not in Miller's script.\n\n"

Adrien goes to the home of Frantz's parents, Dr. Hans and Magda Hoffmeister, and tries to speak to Hans, but when Hans hears that Adrien is French, he tells Adrien that a Frenchman killed his son and, calling the French murderers, drives Adrien away. Adrien tells Hans, \"You are right. I am a murderer\". Meanwhile, Anna is rejecting the unwelcome advances of an older suitor, particularly as she cannot forget Frantz. Anna sees Adrien at the grave and sends him a invitation him to the Hoffmeister home. After she tells the Hoffmeisters that Adrien was leaving flowers at Frantz's grave, they relent. Adrien visits and, upon questioning, recounts falsely that he and Frantz were students together in Paris before the war. He even describes their supposed last day together, when they visited the Louvre. Anna takes Adrien to the places she and Frantz used to go together, including the mountaintop where he proposed to her. Adrien, whose demeanour reminds them of Frantz, lifts Anna and the Hoffmeisters out of their despair.

Adrien found Frantz's last letter to Anna on his body and, wracked with guilt, resolved to visit Germany in order to seek forgiveness. Anna, heartbroken, says that she will tell the Hoffmeisters so that Adrien does not, resolving it is better for the Hoffmans to remain in ignorance of Adrein's role after they have come to like him and see him as a connection to their lost son. Adrien returns to Paris and Anna sinks back into despair, attempting to drown herself. She does not reply to Adrien's letters and destroys one he enclosed for the Hoffmans confessing his true role. After being nursed back to health by the Hoffmeisters, Anna's spirits gradually recover and she decides to contact Adrien again.

She discusses film-making and wants Panahi's advice on creating a short film for a school project; her teacher has talked about several rules on creating films in Iran, including the avoidance of siahnamayi, or portraying a dark image about the country. However, Hana's teacher also stated that people should create films as they see fit. The two stop near a coffeehouse where Panahi meets with a family friend he has not seen for seven years. The latter inquires about a burglary he recently experienced and his dilemma of not informing the authorities about the thieves, whom he personally knows, as they are poor and have nothing else to lose.

This results in him being stripped of his position at the school, his works (including his famous, \u201cNeo-Plastic Room\u201d at the Muzeum Sztuki in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a) were either withdrawn from public view or simply destroyed. Then the bureaucracy denied him his ability to make a living as a sign-painter, prevented him buying art supplies, and collecting food stamps.[6]\n\nSee also[edit]\n"

A strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to abort the mission. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm, and telemetry from his suit's biomonitor is damaged and stops. With Watney believed dead, the storm worsening by the second, and the MAV on the verge of toppling, mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel, the Hermes.\n\nWatney awakens after the storm to a low-oxygen warning and returns to the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\"). Performing self-surgery, he removes from his abdomen the debris that destroyed his biomonitor. He begins a video diary. Lacking communications with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV will be landing 3,200 kilometers (2,000\u00a0mi) away at the Schiaparelli crater. Watney's immediate concern is food; being the mission's botanist, he improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with the crew's feces, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes intended for the Thanksgiving dinner. He also begins to modify the only functional rover for longer journeys in preparation for the long-distance travel.\n\n"

His job is to salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag bodies from the gas chambers and scrub the chambers before the next group arrives to be gassed. He works stoically, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. One day following the gassing, he finds a boy who survived the gas, but is unconscious. From a distance, Saul witnesses a Nazi physician check vital signs, then methodically suffocate the boy and call for an autopsy. Saul steps forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Mikl\u00f3s (S\u00e1ndor Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r), a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to Josef Mengele. He asks Mikl\u00f3s to not perform the autopsy so he can give the boy a proper Jewish burial. Mikl\u00f3s declines his plea, but allows him time alone with the boy before the autopsy and subsequent cremation. Saul returns later and steals the boy's body and goes in search of a Rabbi to perform the ritual. He goes to Rabbi Frankel (Jerzy Walczak\u00a0[pl]) in the crematorium, who dismisses Saul's concern and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.\n\nSaul overhears Sonderkommando Abraham (Levente Moln\u00e1r), talk about an uprising against the SS-guards with Oberkapo Biedermann (Urs Rechn). Biedermann first wants to photograph the camp's atrocities using a camera collected from the clothing of an earlier gassed caravan, and smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi and Abraham tells him of \"the Renegade,\" a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewellery for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing.\n\n"
