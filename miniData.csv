Joker	['Joaquin Phoenix']	Todd Phillips	['(2019-08-31) (Venice)', '(2019-10-04) (United States)']	"Plot
In 1981, party clown, social outsider, and aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. Gotham's class society is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving segments of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, and depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attack Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up comedy show at a nightclub.

While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired by his agent. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen who were harassing a female passenger; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third to avoid getting caught by the police. The murders are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, who labels those envious of more successful people as ""clowns"". Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his social worker to prescribe him his daily medication.
